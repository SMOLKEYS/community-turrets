# SMOLKEYS Turrets

Adds in new turrets to the game.
My first normal-ish mod.



Info:

|:------:|:------:|
![sprite](https://github.com/SMOLKEYS/turrets-mod/blob/master/sprites/blocks/turrets/barrager.png)Barrager|A more powerful version of a Swarmer, only has 2 barrels but does a lot of damage. Shoots 2 missiles every second.
![sprite2](https://github.com/SMOLKEYS/turrets-mod/blob/master/sprites/blocks/turrets/blaster.png)Blaster|A more powerful version of a Barrager, only has 1 barrel but does a load of damage. Uses 1500 power and shoots 1 large missile every 3 seconds. Is the most expensive turret but makes up by having more range than a Foreshadow and being able to kill a Reign in less than a few seconds.
